# Technical Stack

This document details the technologies, libraries, and patterns used in our XR interface demo project.

## Core Technologies

### React
- **Version**: 18.x
- **Purpose**: Primary UI framework
- **Key Features Used**:
  - Functional components with hooks
  - Context API for state management
  - Suspense for loading states
  - Concurrent rendering features
- **Benefits**: Component reusability, declarative programming model, and efficient updates through the virtual DOM

### Three.js
- **Version**: 0.175.0
- **Purpose**: 3D rendering engine
- **Key Features Used**:
  - WebGL renderer
  - Scene graph management
  - Camera systems
  - Material and lighting systems
- **Benefits**: Mature 3D library with extensive documentation and community support

## Integration Libraries

### React Three Fiber (@react-three/fiber)
- **Version**: 9.1.2
- **Purpose**: React reconciler for Three.js
- **Key Features Used**:
  - Declarative Three.js scene construction
  - React state-driven 3D updates
  - Event handling system
  - Performance optimizations
- **Benefits**: Allows using React patterns to control 3D scenes

### React Three Drei (@react-three/drei)
- **Version**: 10.0.6
- **Purpose**: Helper components for React Three Fiber
- **Key Components Used**:
  - `<OrbitControls />` - Camera controls
  - `<Html />` - DOM elements in 3D space
  - `<Text />` - High-quality text rendering
  - `<Box />`, `<Sphere />` - Primitive shapes
  - `<useGLTF />` - 3D model loading
- **Benefits**: Pre-built solutions for common 3D UI challenges

## Additional Libraries

### Animation
- **Library**: GSAP/Framer Motion (to be implemented)
- **Purpose**: Fluid animations and transitions
- **Key Features**: Timeline-based animations, spring physics, gesture recognition
- **Benefits**: Professional-quality motion design

### State Management
- **Approach**: React Context API + Custom Hooks
- **Structure**: 
  - App-level context for global state
  - Component-specific state with useState/useReducer
  - Optimized re-renders with useMemo/useCallback
- **Benefits**: Simplified data flow, reduced prop drilling, maintainable state architecture

## Development Tools

### Build System
- **Primary**: Vite
- **Benefits**: Fast refresh, efficient bundling, modern defaults
- **Configuration**: Optimized for React and Three.js

### Version Control
- **System**: Git
- **Workflow**: Feature branch development
- **Commit Style**: Conventional commits (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, etc.)

### Code Quality
- **Linting**: ESLint with React hooks plugin
- **Formatting**: Prettier
- **Type Checking**: JSDoc or TypeScript annotations (optional enhancement)

## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Rendering
- Use of `instancedMesh` for repeated elements
- Proper use of `useMemo` to prevent recreation of Three.js objects
- Dynamic level-of-detail based on device capabilities
- Frustum culling for off-screen elements

### Assets
- Texture compression and mipmap generation
- GLTF model optimization (draco compression)
- Asset preloading and progressive loading

### Memory Management
- Component cleanup with useEffect return functions
- Proper disposal of Three.js resources
- Avoiding memory leaks in animation loops

## Browser Compatibility

### Targeted Platforms
- Modern desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- WebXR-compatible mobile browsers
- Optimized for standalone VR headsets

### Progressive Enhancement
- Fallback rendering for non-WebXR environments
- Responsive design for various display sizes
- Input adaptations (mouse/touch/controller)

## Future Considerations

### WebXR Integration
- Implementation of WebXR API for immersive sessions
- Controller input mapping
- Spatial tracking integration

### Performance Monitoring
- Frame rate tracking
- Memory usage monitoring
- Load time optimization

### Accessibility
- Color contrast considerations
- Alternative input methods
- Screen reader compatibility where applicable
